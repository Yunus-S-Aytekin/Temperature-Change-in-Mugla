# Temperature changes in Mugla

- I created this graph for Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course offered by Michigan on coursera.

### Research Question:

- How has Turkey's number of tourists in four Aegean cities (İzmir, Aydın, Muğla, Denizli) changed over the last 27 years?

### About The Image:

- This Image shows the change in the number of tourists in the Aegean Region. These data were taken from TÜİK(Turkish Statistical Institute).
- The graph compares the popularity of 4 Aegean cities in terms of the number of tourists.
- The plots indicate the change in the number of tourists per year from 1995 to 2022. This allows us to compare which city is more popular than the others.
